# 1.27 Pitch to 2.54 Pitch Converter Boards

Minimal, open-source, KiCad boards for converting dual-row 1.27 mm connectors to standard 2.54 mm headers.
Useful for prototyping, debugging, or breaking out fine-pitch connectors to breadboard-friendly spacing. Available variants: 40-pin, 20-pin, and 10-pin.
